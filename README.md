    <h3 align="center">The ultimate subdomain monitorization framework</h3>
</p>

Subdomain monitoring framework inspired by [subalert](https://github.com/yassineaboukir/sublert) project

# Setting up the environment
You need:
- Python  >= 3.6 ( python 2 is not supported )
- Linux server e.g(Amanzon EC2) [64bit]

Before we start you need to install the requirements
```
$ sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
After installing the requirements now you're ready to go

# Configuration

This tool requires a slack workspace to report the findings  

You need to edit the `config/default.json` 
```json

{
	"settings":{
		"slack_channel":"change this to your channel id",
		"slack_token":"change this to your bot user Oauth token",
	}
}
```

```
$ python monitor.py -w watch_targets.txt
```
if everything is configured currectly to should see this message on your slack channel

Monitorizer supports more than one subdomain enumeration tool to achieve the best result
```python

scanners = [
	aiodnsbrute, # https://github.com/blark/aiodnsbrute (included)
	subfinder,   # https://github.com/subfinder/subfinder (included)
	sublist3r,   # https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r (included)
	dnsrecon,    # https://github.com/darkoperator/dnsrecon (included)
	dnscan,      # https://github.com/rbsec/dnscan (included)
	subbrute,    # https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute (included)
	amass,       # https://github.com/OWASP/Amass (included)
]

```
command lines can be found at `config/default.json`

It is also recommended to add your API keys in the /config/amass.ini file such as :
```
...
[SecurityTrails]
apikey = XXXXX
...
```

# How to run

As the script runs once everyday to need to host it on a running linux server
```
$ ssh myserver@somewhere.host
$ ls
Monitorizer
$ cd Monitorizer
$ screen -dmS monitorizer bash -c 'python3 monitor.py -w targets.txt'
```

# Slack Commands
Monitorizer supports slack commands by mentioning the bot   
  
![](https://i.ibb.co/NFL2N7r/image.png)  
  
To Enable Slack commands you have to enable [Event Subscriptions](https://api.slack.com/events-api) and set the [Request URL] to http://youip:6500/slack
